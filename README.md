## Weather Project

This project has been created by Parsity, an online software engineering course. The work in this repository is wholly of the student based on a sample starter project that can be accessed by looking at the repository that this project forks.

If you have any questions about this project or the program in general, visit [parsity.io](https://parsity.io/) or email hello@parsity.io.

I, Benjamin Corbett, worked on this project during my time at parsity by forking it over and then submitting a pull request to get a final grade.
This project has bootstrap, javascript, jQuery, Handlebars, and fontawesome.  In this application you are able to input a city name and recieve a 5 day and current forecast.
